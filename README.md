The Nucleus framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using
Kotlin. It is based on [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/)
and adds native window decorations, deep operating-system integration, code signing,
and native installers — all configured through a single Gradle DSL. Your app runs
either as a [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/) or on the JVM.

It targets the gap between "a Compose Desktop window" and "an application the operating
system treats as its own" — the work that is normally spread across a dozen half-maintained
libraries and a hand-written packaging pipeline. Every OS integration is a real platform
API behind a Kotlin one: no AWT dependency on the Tao backend, and the accessibility layer
is verified against AT-SPI, UI Automation, and macOS AX in CI on all three platforms.

Read [Why Nucleus](https://nucleusframework.dev/en/docs/why-nucleus) for how it compares to
vanilla Compose Desktop, Electron, and Tauri.

## Project status

Published releases are `2.5.x` (latest tag `v2.5.0`). Nucleus is under active development
and moves fast. All published runtime modules run in Kotlin `explicitApi()` mode with
their public surface locked by a binary-compatibility dump (`api/*.api`, checked by
`apiCheck` via kotlinx binary-compatibility-validator). Breaking changes to a public FQN
or signature fail CI. The one exception is `decorated-window-jewel` (JVM 25 bytecode),
which still uses `explicitApi()` but is not dumped until BCV can read class-file major
version 69. The Tao backend is the recommended one for new projects —
`decorated-window-jni` and `decorated-window-jbr` are deprecated and receive fixes only.

## Installation

Nucleus ships as a Gradle plugin. Apply it alongside the Kotlin and Compose plugins in
your module's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.4.10"
    id("org.jetbrains.compose") version "1.12.0"
    id("dev.nucleusframework") version "2.5.0"
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
}

dependencies {
    implementation(compose.desktop.currentOs)
    // Entry point — provides nucleusApplication and DecoratedWindow
    implementation("dev.nucleusframework:nucleus.nucleus-application:2.5.0")
    // Tao backend — Rust-native windowing
    implementation("dev.nucleusframework:nucleus.decorated-window-tao:2.5.0")
}
```

For more installation options, see the
[install guide](https://nucleusframework.dev/en/docs/start/install) and
[project setup](https://nucleusframework.dev/en/docs/start/project-setup).

## Requirements

Nucleus builds on Compose Multiplatform and requires:

| Requirement | Version | Note |
|-------------|---------|------|
| JDK | 17+ (25+ for AOT cache) | JBR 25 recommended |
| Kotlin | 2.4.10+ | This repo builds with Kotlin 2.4.10 |
| Compose Multiplatform | 1.12.0 | Required by the 2.5 line; will not run on 1.11.x |
| Gradle | 9.0+ | Bundled wrapper is Gradle 9.4.0 |

## Platform support

Each build can compile, run, and package for macOS, Windows, and Linux from a single
codebase.

* **macOS** — Intel (`x64`) and Apple Silicon (`arm64`), shipped as a universal binary. Liquid Glass on macOS 26.
* **Windows** — `x64` and `arm64`.
* **Linux** — `x64` and `arm64`, with Wayland and X11 support.

## Getting started

Create `src/main/kotlin/com/example/Main.kt`:

```kotlin
package com.example

import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Box
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import dev.nucleusframework.application.DecoratedWindow
import dev.nucleusframework.application.nucleusApplication

fun main(args: Array<String>) = nucleusApplication(args) {
    DecoratedWindow(
        onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication,
        title = "MyApp",
    ) {
        Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
            Text("Hello from Nucleus")
        }
    }
}
```

`nucleusApplication` initializes GraalVM native-image support, takes the
single-instance lock, and primes autolaunch / Windows AUMID when those
modules are on the classpath. Pass the process `args` so deep links,
file associations, and "started at login" see the original command line.
The default backend is `Auto` (Tao if `decorated-window-tao` is present,
otherwise AWT). Inside the block you can call `onDeepLink { }` and
`aotTraining()`; plugin-injected metadata is `NucleusApp`, not a generated
constants object.

On macOS the Tao backend delivers trackpad gestures to Compose as pan events
(`PointerEventType.PanStart` / `PanMove` / `PanEnd`, with `panOffset` in
pixels) and mouse-wheel notches as `Scroll`, with the same distances the AWT
backend produces. Foundation's `Modifier.scrollable` handles both; a custom
`pointerInput` that only reacts to `PointerEventType.Scroll` must also handle
pan, or start the app with `-Dnucleus.tao.trackpadPanEvents=false` to receive
AWT-style `Scroll` events for everything.

Then configure packaging in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
nucleus.application {
    mainClass = "com.example.MainKt"

    nativeDistributions {
        packageName = "MyApp"
        packageVersion = "1.0.0"
        targetFormats(TargetFormat.Dmg, TargetFormat.Msi, TargetFormat.Deb)
    }
}
```

```shell
./gradlew run                              # Run locally in a native Tao window
./gradlew packageDistributionForCurrentOS  # Build an installer for your OS
```

The full [quickstart](https://nucleusframework.dev/en/docs/start/quickstart) walks through
each step.

## What Nucleus provides

**Ship everywhere** — 18 packaging formats (DMG, PKG, EXE, MSI, NSIS, NSIS-Web, Portable,
AppX, DEB, RPM, Pacman, AppImage, raw AppImage, Snap, Flatpak, ZIP, TAR, 7Z), store
publishing (Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, Snapcraft, Flathub), code signing and
notarization, built-in auto-update, deep links, and file associations.

**Feel native** — Decorated windows with native controls, notifications, taskbar/dock
badges and menus, media controls (MPRIS, Now Playing, SMTC), dark mode, accent colors,
global hotkeys, system tray, native context menus, and OS spell check — all behind
clean Kotlin APIs.

**Perform** — GraalVM Native Image compiles your app to a standalone binary with automatic
reachability metadata; a Hello-World Compose window cold-starts in about 0.2 s and around
30 MB of RAM (measured on Windows 11). Or stay on the JVM with an AOT cache (JDK 25+) and
ProGuard-optimized release builds.
