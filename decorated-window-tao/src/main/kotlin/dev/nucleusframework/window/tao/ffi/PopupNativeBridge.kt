 * JNI bridge to the macOS popup panel helper (`macos/popup_panel.m`,
 * shipped as `libnucleus_tao_macos_popup.dylib`).
 *
 * Phase 1 of the Compose-popup-via-NSPanel architecture: lets us mint a
 * borderless transparent `NSPanel` attached as a child window of the
 * host `NSWindow` and visually verify its position. No Skia, no
 * Compose, no event forwarding yet — those come in subsequent phases.
 *
 * Threading: every entry point must run on the macOS main thread (= Tao
 * event-loop thread = Compose dispatcher thread). The functions touch
 * AppKit objects directly.
 *
 * Wire format: coordinates are in **physical pixels**, top-left origin,
 * relative to the parent window's content area (matching Compose's
 * `boundsInWindow`). The native side flips Y and translates to AppKit's
 * bottom-left, points-based screen coords using the parent window's
 * `backingScaleFactor`.
