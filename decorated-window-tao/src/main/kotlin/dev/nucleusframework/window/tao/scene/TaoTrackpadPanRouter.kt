/**
 * Turns the macOS trackpad scroll gesture stream ([TaoScrollGesturePhase])
 * into Compose's `PanStart` / `PanMove` / `PanEnd` (#654).
 *
 * Why the stream is not mapped one-to-one: Compose's `TrackpadScrollingLogic`
 * runs its own fling from the tracked velocity as soon as it sees `PanEnd`,
 * while AppKit keeps delivering the inertial *momentum* tail after the fingers
 * lift (`momentumPhase`). Closing the pan on the finger `Ended` would stack
 * the two animations and the tail would re-open a second pan. The pan is
 * therefore kept open across the momentum tail and closed on `MomentumEnded`.
 * AppKit does not say in advance whether a tail will follow, so the finger
 * `Ended` only *schedules* the `PanEnd` and a momentum event arriving within
 * [graceMillis] cancels it. By the time the pan really ends the tracked
 * velocity is ~0 and Compose adds no fling of its own — the platform drives
 * the inertia, exactly as under AWT where every step is a plain wheel event.
 *
 * An open pan is always bounded: every step re-arms an end timer ([graceMillis]
 * after the finger `Ended`, [stallMillis] otherwise), so a stream that is cut
 * short — fingers resting on the glass during the tail (`MayBegin`, which
 * closes the pan at once), a window losing key status, a terminal step that
 * never arrives — cannot leave Compose's scroll session open. A finger step
 * that still carries a delta is delivered even when no pan is open (AppKit's
 * `Ended` can hold the last finger movement, and a `Began` may have been
 * missed), so no finger distance is dropped; momentum steps, in contrast, only
 * continue an open pan — a late tail after the grace already closed the pan
 * is handed back to the caller (`false`) rather than stacked on Compose's fling.
 *
 * [send] receives the pan offset in AWT `preciseWheelRotation` units (the
 * shape of [dev.nucleusframework.window.tao.TaoPointerScrollEvent.dxAwt]); the
 * caller converts to pixels. [schedule] runs `action` after `delayMillis` on
 * the UI thread and returns a cancel handle. UI thread only.
